# Description

We wanted to make searching for houses easier than ever by using multiple server sided APIâ€™s to look up properties for sale based on the zip code entered.
People have complained that it is too difficult to search for current houses in a specific area without having to look up different companies' websites. What we did is consolidated all of this information into one fine piece of... properties.

# Tasks

- When the user opens the webpage, YUP THE BOYS
- Then they user is presented with a search bar, contact form, and an about us - explaining what the site is made of.
- When the user enters a zip code into the search bar
- Then the user is presented with a static image of the property and additional information regarding the property.
- When the user enters an incorrect zip code into the search bar.
- Then the user is presented with a modal, that presents an error in the search per their input.
- When the user clicks on the NEXT button.
- Then the user is presented with the next property found for the inputted zip code.
- When the user clicks on the PREVIOUS button.
- Then the user is presented with the prior property found for the inputted zip code.
